{"id":"PathCollab-1lou","title":"[EPIC] Phase 0: Architecture Stabilization - Unified Port \u0026 Single-Origin Foundation","description":"## Background \u0026 Context\n\nPathCollab currently has architectural complexity that impedes debugging and reliable operation:\n- Multiple services on different ports (3000 for frontend, 8080 for backend, 3001 for WSIStreamer)\n- CORS issues when services communicate across origins\n- Inconsistent port configurations across README, docker-compose, and config files\n- External WSIStreamer dependency adds deployment complexity\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe current multi-origin architecture creates several issues:\n1. **CORS Complexity**: Browser security restrictions complicate cross-origin requests\n2. **Config Fragmentation**: Different documents specify different ports/URLs\n3. **Dev/Prod Parity**: Development setup differs significantly from production\n4. **External Dependencies**: WSIStreamer adds another moving part to manage\n\n## Goals\n\n1. **Single Origin**: All client requests go to one endpoint - server proxies tile requests\n2. **Unified Configuration**: One source of truth for ports and URLs\n3. **Simplified Dev Experience**: Single command to start a working viewer\n4. **Reduced Dependencies**: Remove WSIStreamer requirement; use local OpenSlide\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Single command starts a working viewer with no CORS errors\n- [ ] All tile requests proxied through the main server\n- [ ] README, docker-compose, and config all use consistent ports\n- [ ] WSIStreamer removed as a required external service\n- [ ] `dev solo mode` flag bypasses WebSocket/sessions for debugging\n- [ ] Environment matrix documented: dev, local-docker, production\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n1. Add tile proxy endpoints to the Rust server\n2. Configure Vite dev server to proxy all /api routes\n3. Remove WSIStreamer from default docker-compose\n4. Add LocalSlideService using OpenSlide for direct slide access\n5. Implement PUBLIC_BASE_URL for consistent link generation\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis phase has no dependencies - it is the foundation for all subsequent work.\nAll other phases depend on this being completed first.\n\n## Files Likely Affected\n\n- server/src/slide/ (LocalSlideService implementation)\n- server/src/main.rs (routing configuration)\n- server/src/config.rs (port and URL configuration)\n- web/vite.config.ts (dev proxy configuration)\n- docker-compose.yml (service configuration)\n- README.md (documentation updates)\n- .env.example (environment defaults)\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n- **Risk**: OpenSlide library compatibility issues\n  **Mitigation**: OpenSlide-rs is well-tested; add fallback error handling\n- **Risk**: Performance impact of proxy layer\n  **Mitigation**: Add appropriate caching headers; benchmark tile latency\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- Zero CORS-related errors in console\n- Tile request latency \u003c 200ms through proxy\n- Development environment boots in \u003c 30 seconds","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"pierreantoine.bannier@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:46:01.640557701+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier","updated_at":"2026-01-14T16:46:01.640557701+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-6qlw","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:50:59.954428828+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-qiyv","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:51:00.082921906+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-f3ib","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:51:00.243823809+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-iu50","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:51:00.362940068+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-i4d1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:51:00.502557924+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-ii3o","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:51:00.641150037+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-btdu","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:51:00.833438487+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-p9t6","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:51:01.011371524+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-npkg","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:51:01.244162063+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-fulz","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:05:26.009635595+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-90zt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:20:49.610654412+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-vonz","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:20:51.278486513+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-ad16","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:20:52.639086154+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-gg8i","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:20:54.659234623+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-vcz3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:20:56.379412379+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-8w2b","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:20:58.781114717+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-b71q","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:21:08.953928355+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-1lou","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-22wf","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:21:10.168814986+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"}]}

{"id":"PathCollab-3tel","title":"[EPIC] Phase 4: Debuggability \u0026 Testing Foundations - Deterministic, Reproducible, Observable","description":"## Background \u0026 Context\n\nCurrently, debugging PathCollab issues requires:\n- Checking browser DevTools network tab\n- Reading server logs with varying verbosity\n- Manually tracking WebSocket message flow\n- No easy way to reproduce specific scenarios\n\nThis makes bug reports hard to investigate and issues hard to reproduce.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nDebugging and testing are difficult because:\n- **Observability Gap**: No unified view of system state\n- **Non-Deterministic Tests**: Tests depend on external services\n- **Hidden State**: WebSocket state not visible in UI\n- **Fixture Absence**: No standard test slides/overlays\n- **CI Complexity**: Tests need full infrastructure\n\n## Goals\n\n1. **Debug Panel**: Built-in UI showing connection, tiles, overlay, session state\n2. **Deterministic Fixtures**: Small demo slide and overlay for testing\n3. **Comprehensive Tests**: Unit tests for session logic, E2E for UI flows\n4. **Mock Services**: CI can run without external tile servers\n5. **Solo Mode Tests**: Test suite for non-collaborative scenarios\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Debug panel in sidebar shows WS state, retry count\n- [ ] Debug panel shows tile request/error counts\n- [ ] Debug panel shows overlay load progress\n- [ ] Debug panel shows current session ID and role\n- [ ] In-app log view with copy-to-clipboard\n- [ ] Network error banner for offline/proxy issues\n- [ ] 'Reset app state' action for fast recovery\n- [ ] Demo slide and overlay fixtures exist\n- [ ] Unit tests for session creation, roles, presence\n- [ ] Playwright tests: viewer load, pan/zoom, copy link, follow\n- [ ] Mock tile server for CI\n- [ ] Solo mode test suite (no WS)\n\n## Debug Panel Specification\n\n```\n┌─ Debug ─────────────────────────────┐\n│ Connection                          │\n│   State: ● Connected                │\n│   Retries: 0                        │\n│   Latency: 45ms                     │\n│                                     │\n│ Tiles                               │\n│   Requested: 127                    │\n│   Loaded: 125                       │\n│   Errors: 2                         │\n│   Avg Latency: 85ms                 │\n│                                     │\n│ Overlay                             │\n│   Status: Loaded                    │\n│   Progress: 100%                    │\n│   Cells: 45,230                     │\n│                                     │\n│ Session                             │\n│   ID: abc123xyz                     │\n│   Role: Presenter                   │\n│   Participants: 3                   │\n│                                     │\n│ [View Logs] [Copy Debug Info]       │\n│ [Reset State]                       │\n└─────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n**Unit Tests (Vitest)**:\n- useSession hook: create, join, role assignment\n- useWebSocket hook: connect, reconnect, message queue\n- Presence aggregation logic\n- Session state machine transitions\n\n**E2E Tests (Playwright)**:\n- Viewer loads and tiles render\n- Pan and zoom gestures work\n- Copy link button works\n- Follower join + follow presenter\n- Overlay upload and toggle\n\n**Mock Services**:\n- Mock tile server returning test images\n- Mock WebSocket server for join flows\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n1. Create DebugPanel sidebar component\n2. Add debug state collection hooks\n3. Create demo slide (small TIFF or synthetic tiles)\n4. Create tiny overlay JSON for tests\n5. Write unit tests for hooks and state\n6. Write Playwright E2E test suite\n7. Create mock tile server Docker image\n8. Add solo mode flag for isolated testing\n\n## Dependencies\n\n**Depends On**: Phase 1 (Viewer-First UX), Phase 2 (Simplified Session)\n- Requires sidebar for debug panel placement\n- Requires simplified session for predictable test scenarios\n\n## Files Likely Affected\n\n- web/src/components/sidebar/DebugSection.tsx (new)\n- web/src/hooks/useDebugState.ts (new)\n- web/src/test/fixtures/ (demo assets)\n- tests/e2e/ (Playwright tests)\n- server/tests/ (integration tests)\n- scripts/mock-tile-server/ (CI helper)\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- Debug panel visible in \u003c 100ms\n- All tests pass without external services in CI\n- Bug reports include debug info automatically\n- Time to reproduce reported issue \u003c 5 minutes","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"pierreantoine.bannier@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:47:55.744064914+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier","updated_at":"2026-01-14T16:47:55.744064914+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"PathCollab-3tel","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-ri96","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:48:14.633321417+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-3tel","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-8thi","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:48:14.735381905+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-3tel","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-qa00","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:53:08.871781075+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-3tel","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-r1bu","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:53:08.976202905+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-3tel","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-mmmn","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:01:15.679436609+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-3tel","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-bti8","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:01:15.794509243+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-3tel","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-jyoc","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:01:15.904618815+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-3tel","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-d006","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:01:16.010171291+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-3tel","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-rute","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:02:33.940899802+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-3tel","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-kud3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:02:34.048785252+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-3tel","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-dcim","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:02:34.147814803+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-3tel","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-4q5m","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:02:34.263811655+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-3tel","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-x34j","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:02:34.373781441+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-3tel","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-pkkv","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:05:26.351734103+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-3tel","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-tjth","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:05:26.456134026+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-3tel","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-5i6q","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:05:26.561233666+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"}]}

Viewer First\n\nThe slide viewer IS the landing page. Users should see content immediately, not setup screens or marketing pages.\n\n**Do**: Load a slide automatically\n**Don't**: Show 'Create Session' before showing a slide\n\n## 2. Progressive Disclosure\n\nStart simple. Advanced features are discoverable but not required.\n\n**Do**: Hide debug panel by default\n**Don't**: Show all options upfront\n\n## 3. One-Click Actions\n\nCommon actions should require one click maximum.\n\n**Do**: 'Copy Link' copies immediately (auto-creating session)\n**Don't**: Require 'Create Session' → 'Get Link' → 'Copy'\n\n## 4. Clear Feedback\n\nEvery action should have visible feedback.\n\n**Do**: Show 'Copied!' when link is copied\n**Don't**: Silent clipboard write with no indication\n\n## 5. Graceful Degradation\n\nCore functionality works even when features fail.\n\n**Do**: Viewer works without WebSocket\n**Don't**: Block viewer if WS fails\n\n## 6. Minimal Cognitive Load\n\nReduce decisions users must make.\n\n**Do**: Auto-assign presenter role\n**Don't**: Ask 'Would you like to be presenter?'\n\n## 7. Premium Feel\n\nUI should feel professional and polished.\n\n**Do**: Use consistent spacing, premium fonts, smooth animations\n**Don't**: Mix font sizes, skip animations, use jarring colors\n\n---\n\n## Before Submitting a PR\n\nAsk yourself:\n1. Does this add user steps? Can they be reduced?\n2. Is there clear feedback for actions?\n3. Does it work without optional features?\n4.

{"id":"PathCollab-8thi","title":"[EPIC] Phase 2: Simplified Session \u0026 Sharing - Auto-Create, One-Click Share","description":"## Background \u0026 Context\n\nCurrent session flow requires explicit user actions:\n1. User clicks 'Create Session'\n2. Server generates session with secrets (join_secret, presenter_key)\n3. User manually copies/shares link with secrets embedded\n4. Joiners must enter through special join flow\n\nThis complexity is invisible friction that reduces collaboration adoption.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe explicit session creation paradigm has issues:\n- **Mental Model Mismatch**: Users think 'share my view' not 'create session'\n- **Unnecessary Complexity**: Multiple secrets (join, presenter) confuse users\n- **Delayed Collaboration**: Can't share until session explicitly created\n- **URL Complexity**: Links with hash-encoded secrets look suspicious\n\n## Goals\n\n1. **Auto-Session**: Session auto-created when collaboration enabled\n2. **One-Click Share**: Copy link button available immediately\n3. **Implicit Roles**: Presenter/follower roles determined automatically\n4. **Simple URLs**: Clean share links without visible secrets\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Session auto-creates in background when collab enabled\n- [ ] Share link available immediately in sidebar\n- [ ] Copy link shows clear success confirmation\n- [ ] Presenter/follower roles assigned implicitly (first = presenter)\n- [ ] 'Follow presenter' toggle for followers with smooth animation\n- [ ] 'Jump to presenter view' button for quick sync\n- [ ] Session works without explicit creation step\n- [ ] Advanced secrets can be enabled via config flag\n\n## New Collaboration Flow\n\n**Before (Current)**:\n1. Open app → Landing page\n2. Select slide → Create session button\n3. Click create → Wait for session\n4. Copy link with secrets → Share\n5. Joiner opens link → Join flow\n\n**After (Simplified)**:\n1. Open app → See slide immediately\n2. Click 'Share' → Link copied (session auto-created)\n3. Joiner opens link → Sees same slide, follows presenter\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n1. Add auto-session creation when collab toggle enabled\n2. Simplify share response to single token\n3. Move join_secret/presenter_key behind ADVANCED_SECRETS config\n4. Implement implicit role assignment (connection order)\n5. Add 'Follow presenter' toggle component\n6.

Most use cases don't need separate secrets.\n\n## Task\n\nSimplify to a single share token:\n\n1. **Single token generation**:\n   - Generate one `share_token` per session\n   - Token allows joining AND presenter reclaim (if original presenter)\n   - Shorter, cleaner URLs\n\n2. **URL format**:\n   - Before: `/s/abc123#join=xxx\u0026presenter=yyy`\n   - After: `/s/abc123#t=shorttoken`\n\n3. **Advanced mode behind flag**:\n   - Add `ADVANCED_SECRETS=true` config flag\n   - When enabled, return separate join/presenter secrets\n   - Default: single token mode\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Share URLs use single token by default\n- [ ] Token allows join + presenter reclaim\n- [ ] URLs significantly shorter\n- [ ] ADVANCED_SECRETS flag enables separate secrets\n- [ ] Old URL format still works (backwards compat)\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n**Token Generation**:\n```rust\nimpl Session {\n    pub fn generate_share_token(\u0026self) -\u003e String {\n        // Generate 64-bit token (compact but secure for this use case)\n        let bytes: [u8; 8] = rand::random();\n        base32_encode(\u0026bytes)  // ~13 chars\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**URL Parsing** (frontend):\n```typescript\n// Support both formats\nconst parseSessionUrl = (hash: string) =\u003e {\n    const params = new URLSearchParams(hash.slice(1));\n    \n    // New format: #t=token\n    if (params.has('t')) {\n        return { token: params.get('t') };\n    }\n    \n    // Legacy format: #join=xxx\u0026presenter=yyy\n    return {\n        joinSecret: params.get('join'),\n        presenterKey: params.get('presenter'),\n    };\n};\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nThe single-token approach is appropriate for this use case because:\n- Sessions are ephemeral (expire after hours)\n- Low-stakes sharing (viewing pathology slides)\n- Token is still 64+ bits of entropy\n- Advanced users can enable separate secrets\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nSimpler share links:\n- Look less suspicious to recipients\n- Easier to communicate verbally\n- Fit better in chat/email\n- Reduce user confusion\n\n## Parent Epic\n\nPhase 2: Simplified Session (PathCollab-8thi)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"pierreantoine.bannier@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:52:24.638145676+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier","updated_at":"2026-01-14T16:52:24.638145676+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"PathCollab-djqp","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-wzwe","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:53:09.094516841+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"}]}

{"id":"PathCollab-f3ib","title":"[4.1.3] Implement tile proxy in server for single-origin architecture","description":"## Background\n\nBrowsers enforce same-origin policy for security. When tiles are served from a different origin than the UI, CORS headers must be configured correctly. This is error-prone and a frequent source of bugs.\n\nThe solution: proxy all tile requests through the main server so the browser only talks to one origin.\n\n## Task\n\nAdd tile proxy endpoints to the Rust server:\n\n1. **Add tile proxy route**:\n   ```\n   GET /api/tiles/{slide_id}/{level}/{x}/{y}\n   ```\n   \n2. **Proxy logic**:\n   - Receive tile request from frontend\n   - Fetch tile from LocalSlideService (or external source if configured)\n   - Return tile bytes with appropriate headers\n   - Add Cache-Control headers for browser caching\n\n3. **Configuration**:\n   - Use SLIDES_DIR env var for local slide path\n   - Ensure JPEG quality configurable via SLIDE_JPEG_QUALITY\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] /api/tiles/{slide_id}/{level}/{x}/{y} endpoint works\n- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console\n- [ ] Tiles load correctly in OpenSeadragon viewer\n- [ ] Cache-Control headers set (e.g., max-age=3600)\n- [ ] Response Content-Type is image/jpeg\n- [ ] Proper error responses for missing tiles (404)\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nIn `server/src/main.rs` or a new `routes/tiles.rs`:\n\n```rust\nasync fn get_tile(\n    Path((slide_id, level, x, y)): Path\u003c(String, u32, u32, u32)\u003e,\n    State(state): State\u003cAppState\u003e,\n) -\u003e Result\u003cimpl IntoResponse, AppError\u003e {\n    let tile = state.slide_service\n        .get_tile(\u0026TileRequest { slide_id, level, x, y })\n        .await?;\n    \n    Ok((\n        [(header::CONTENT_TYPE, \"image/jpeg\"),\n         (header::CACHE_CONTROL, \"public, max-age=3600\")],\n        tile\n    ))\n}\n```\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nSingle-origin architecture eliminates entire classes of bugs:\n- No CORS configuration needed\n- Simpler security model\n- Easier debugging (all traffic in one DevTools tab)\n- Works behind reverse proxies without special config\n\n## Parent Epic\n\nPhase 0: Architecture Stabilization (PathCollab-1lou)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"pierreantoine.bannier@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:49:26.708416986+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier","updated_at":"2026-01-14T16:49:26.708416986+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"PathCollab-f3ib","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-qiyv","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:51:09.54772849+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"}]}

The WebSocket connection, session management, and presence updates add complexity that can mask simpler bugs.\n\nA 'dev solo mode' allows developers to focus on viewer functionality in isolation.\n\n## Task\n\nAdd a flag that disables collaboration while keeping the viewer fully functional:\n\n1. **Add configuration flag**:\n   - `DEV_SOLO_MODE=true` environment variable (frontend)\n   - `VITE_SOLO_MODE=true` for Vite\n\n2. **Behavior in solo mode**:\n   - Skip WebSocket connection entirely\n   - Don't create/join sessions\n   - Viewer works as standalone slide viewer\n   - All overlay features still work\n   - Debug panel shows 'Solo Mode' indicator\n\n3. **UI changes in solo mode**:\n   - Session section shows 'Solo Mode' badge\n   - Share button disabled with tooltip explaining why\n   - No presence cursors displayed\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] VITE_SOLO_MODE env var supported\n- [ ] Setting to true disables all WS/session code\n- [ ] Viewer loads and navigates correctly in solo mode\n- [ ] Overlay upload/display works in solo mode\n- [ ] Clear UI indication that collaboration is disabled\n- [ ] No console errors about WS connection in solo mode\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn `web/src/hooks/useSession.ts`:\n```typescript\nconst SOLO_MODE = import.meta.env.VITE_SOLO_MODE === 'true';\n\nexport function useSession() {\n    if (SOLO_MODE) {\n        return {\n            status: 'solo',\n            session: null,\n            participants: [],\n            // Stub functions that do nothing\n            createSession: () =\u003e {},\n            joinSession: () =\u003e {},\n            // ...\n        };\n    }\n    // Normal implementation\n}\n```\n\nIn sidebar SessionSection:\n```tsx\n{status === 'solo' \u0026\u0026 (\n    \u003cdiv className=\"bg-yellow-50 text-yellow-800 p-2 rounded\"\u003e\n        Solo Mode - Collaboration disabled\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n)}\n```\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **Debugging viewer bugs**: Focus on tile loading, navigation\n2. **Testing overlays**: Isolate overlay rendering from session state\n3. **Performance profiling**: Remove WS traffic noise\n4. **Offline development**: No server required for basic viewing\n5. **Automated testing**: Simplify test setup\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nReducing complexity during development speeds up debugging and makes it easier to isolate issues.

{"id":"PathCollab-lxi7","title":"[EPIC] Phase 3: Overlay Pipeline Simplification - Canvas2D First, Reliability Over Performance","description":"## Background \u0026 Context\n\nThe current overlay system is complex:\n- Protobuf binary format for overlay files\n- Raster tile generation + vector chunk compression\n- WebGL2 rendering with custom shaders\n- R-tree spatial indexing\n- Multiple coordinate systems\n\nWhile performant, this complexity makes debugging difficult and bugs hard to reproduce.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe overlay pipeline has several pain points:\n- **Debugging Difficulty**: WebGL shaders are opaque; errors hard to trace\n- **Coordinate Confusion**: Multiple coordinate systems (slide, tile, viewport, canvas)\n- **Format Complexity**: Protobuf requires tooling to inspect\n- **Rendering Bugs**: WebGL state management is error-prone\n- **Testing Difficulty**: Hard to create test fixtures for binary format\n\n## Goals\n\n1. **Single Format**: Pick one overlay format for MVP (raster OR simple JSON)\n2. **Canvas2D First**: Use Canvas2D for reliability; WebGL2 later as optimization\n3. **Simple Toggles**: Clear on/off for overlays with opacity control\n4. **Progress Visibility**: Clear load progress and error states\n5. **Easy Debugging**: Human-readable format, visible intermediate states\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Single overlay format documented and validated\n- [ ] Overlays render using Canvas2D (not WebGL2 initially)\n- [ ] Overlay visibility toggle works immediately\n- [ ] Opacity slider responds in \u003c 100ms\n- [ ] Upload progress indicator shows percentage\n- [ ] Clear error states with actionable messages\n- [ ] Overlay can be debugged without specialized tools\n\n## Format Decision: Raster Tiles vs JSON\n\n**Option A: Raster Tiles (Recommended for MVP)**\n- Pros: Simple to render, format-agnostic, works with any tile server\n- Cons: No per-cell interaction, larger file sizes\n- Rendering: Standard image overlay on OpenSeadragon\n\n**Option B: Simple JSON**\n- Pros: Human-readable, easy to validate, interactive\n- Cons: Performance limits at scale\n- Rendering: Canvas2D path drawing\n\n**Recommendation**: Start with raster tiles for MVP reliability, add JSON/WebGL later.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n1. Document chosen overlay format with schema\n2. Add server-side format validation\n3. Implement Canvas2D overlay layer component\n4. Add local storage for overlay files\n5. Create clear toggle and opacity controls\n6. Add progress indicator for upload/load\n7.

{"id":"PathCollab-ri96","title":"[EPIC] Phase 1: Viewer-First UX - Landing Page IS the App","description":"## Background \u0026 Context\n\nThe current PathCollab UX requires multiple steps before users can view a slide:\n1. Visit landing page with marketing content\n2. Select a slide from a list\n3. Click 'Create Session' button\n4. Wait for session creation\n5. Finally see the slide viewer\n\nThis contradicts the core product philosophy: **the landing page should BE the app**.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe multi-step onboarding flow creates friction:\n- **Cognitive Load**: Users must understand concepts (sessions, slides) before seeing value\n- **Time to Value**: Several clicks/seconds before seeing any slide content\n- **Feature Gating**: Useful features hidden behind 'Create Session' action\n- **Discoverability**: New users may not understand what the app does\n\n## Goals\n\n1. **Instant Value**: Show a slide immediately on first load\n2. **Viewer-First Design**: The viewer IS the landing page\n3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Collaboration features are discoverable, not required\n4. **Left Sidebar Pattern**: All controls in a collapsible sidebar, not blocking the view\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] User sees a slide immediately on first page load\n- [ ] No 'Create Session' button required for basic viewing\n- [ ] Left sidebar contains all controls (Session, Slides, People, Layers, Debug)\n- [ ] Compact top status bar shows slide name and connection state\n- [ ] Sidebar is collapsible and keyboard-accessible\n- [ ] Demo slide loads automatically if no slide specified\n- [ ] Loading state is minimal (only while tile metadata loads)\n\n## Layout Specification\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ Status Bar: [Slide Name] [●Connected] [Share: 📋]          │\n├───────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  SIDEBAR  │                                                 │\n│           │                                                 │\n│ ◉ Session │                                                 │\n│   Status  │            S L I D E   V I E W E R              │\n│   Share   │                                                 │\n│           │                (OpenSeadragon)                  │\n│ ◉ Slides  │                                                 │\n│   List    │                                                 │\n│   Recent  │                                                 │\n│           │                                                 │\n│ ◉ People  │                                                 │\n│   List    │                                                 │\n│           │                                                 │\n│ ◉ Layers  │                                                 │\n│   Toggles │                                                 │\n│           │                                                 │\n│ ◉ Debug   │                                                 │\n│   Logs    │                                                 │\n└───────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n1. Replace Home.tsx with viewer-first SlideViewerPage\n2. Auto-resolve slide ID (demo or last-used) on mount\n3. Render OpenSeadragon viewer immediately\n4. Implement collapsible sidebar component with sections\n5. Add top status bar component\n6. Keep all existing viewer functionality intact\n\n## Dependencies\n\n**Depends On**: Phase 0 (Architecture Stabilization)\n- Requires single-origin tile serving to work\n- Requires stable config for PUBLIC_BASE_URL\n\n## Files Likely Affected\n\n- web/src/pages/Home.tsx → Complete rewrite as viewer-first\n- web/src/pages/Session.tsx → Merge into unified viewer page\n- web/src/components/Sidebar.tsx → New component\n- web/src/components/StatusBar.tsx → New component\n- web/src/App.tsx → Simplified routing\n\n## UX Research Backing\n\nThe viewer-first pattern follows established best practices:\n- **Google Maps**: Opens directly to a map, not a 'Create Map Session' page\n- **Figma**: Opens directly to design canvas\n- **Notion**: Opens directly to workspace\nAll controls are in sidebars/toolbars, never blocking the primary content.\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- Time to first visible tile \u003c 3 seconds\n- Zero clicks required to see slide content\n- Sidebar toggle responds in \u003c 100ms\n- All controls reachable via keyboard shortcuts","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"pierreantoine.bannier@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:47:48.578854273+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier","updated_at":"2026-01-14T16:47:48.578854273+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"PathCollab-ri96","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-1lou","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:48:09.920566194+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-ri96","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-k06n","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:54:25.947230819+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-ri96","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-e6jv","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:54:26.07311629+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-ri96","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-jb06","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:54:26.179995581+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-ri96","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-cpxj","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:54:26.298552175+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-ri96","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-sevz","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:54:26.410654925+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-ri96","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-src7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:55:52.575918718+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-ri96","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-7v1k","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:55:52.694975643+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-ri96","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-hsu0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:55:52.832962386+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-ri96","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-txt4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:55:52.963848068+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-ri96","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-fs42","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:58:40.489495044+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"},{"issue_id":"PathCollab-ri96","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-tfze","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T17:05:27.124819494+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"}]}

{"id":"PathCollab-xddl","title":"[4.2.5] Implement single server tick loop for presence and viewport","description":"## Background\n\nCurrently, presence updates (cursors at 30Hz) and viewport updates (10Hz) may have separate broadcast mechanisms. A unified tick loop simplifies the architecture and makes timing predictable.\n\n## Task\n\nCreate a single server tick loop:\n\n1. **Tick loop design**:\n   - Single async task per session\n   - Runs at highest frequency needed (30Hz = 33ms interval)\n   - Each tick: aggregate and broadcast pending updates\n   - Viewport broadcast every 3rd tick (10Hz)\n\n2. **Aggregation logic**:\n   - Cursor updates: collect all since last tick, send delta\n   - Viewport: only send if changed since last broadcast\n   - Batch processing for efficiency\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n```rust\nasync fn session_tick_loop(session_id: SessionId, state: AppState) {\n    let mut interval = tokio::time::interval(Duration::from_millis(33)); // 30Hz\n    let mut tick_count = 0u32;\n    \n    loop {\n        interval.tick().await;\n        tick_count += 1;\n        \n        // Always: presence delta\n        if let Some(delta) = state.get_presence_delta(\u0026session_id) {\n            state.broadcast(\u0026session_id, ServerMessage::Presence(delta));\n        }\n        \n        // Every 3rd tick (10Hz): viewport\n        if tick_count % 3 == 0 {\n            if let Some(viewport) = state.get_presenter_viewport(\u0026session_id) {\n                state.broadcast(\u0026session_id, ServerMessage::Viewport(viewport));\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Single tick loop per active session\n- [ ] Presence broadcasts at 30Hz\n- [ ] Viewport broadcasts at 10Hz\n- [ ] Loop starts when session created\n- [ ] Loop stops when session ends\n- [ ] CPU usage reasonable (\u003c 1% per session)\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Starting the loop**:\n```rust\nimpl SessionManager {\n    pub async fn create_session(\u0026self, slide_id: \u0026str) -\u003e Result\u003cSession\u003e {\n        let session = Session::new(slide_id);\n        \n        // Start tick loop\n        let handle = tokio::spawn(session_tick_loop(\n            session.id.clone(),\n            self.state.clone()\n        ));\n        self.tick_handles.insert(session.id.clone(), handle);\n        \n        Ok(session)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Stopping the loop**:\n```rust\nimpl SessionManager {\n    pub async fn end_session(\u0026self, session_id: \u0026SessionId) {\n        if let Some(handle) = self.tick_handles.remove(session_id) {\n            handle.abort();\n        }\n        // ... cleanup\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nA single tick loop:\n- Makes timing predictable and debuggable\n- Reduces race conditions\n- Simplifies broadcast logic\n- Makes it easy to adjust rates\n\n## Parent Epic\n\nPhase 2: Simplified Session (PathCollab-8thi)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"pierreantoine.bannier@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:52:28.877272793+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier","updated_at":"2026-01-14T16:52:28.877272793+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"PathCollab-xddl","depends_on_id":"PathCollab-9see","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:53:09.238750493+01:00","created_by":"Pierre-Antoine Bannier"}]}
